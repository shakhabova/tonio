      >The financial industry is on the cusp of a significant transformation,
      thanks to the advent of open banking. This innovative concept is set to
      revolutionize how we manage and transfer money, offering unprecedented

  <p class="head"><strong>What is Open Banking?</strong></p>
  <p>
    <span
      >Open banking allows third-party financial service providers to access
      customer banking information through secure application programming
      interfaces (APIs). This means that customers can use their existing bank
      accounts to make transactions and access a range of financial services
      seamlessly. By enabling this secure sharing of financial data, open
      banking fosters greater competition and innovation in the financial
      sector, leading to more tailored and efficient services for
      consumers.</span
