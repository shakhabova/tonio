                  There could be several reasons why a card transfer with Tonio
                  has failed or was declined. Some possible reasons could include:
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Insufficient funds: If you do not have enough money in your
                  account or on your card to cover the transaction, the transfer may
                  be declined.
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Card expiration: If your card has expired, the transfer may be
                  declined.
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Incorrect card information: If you have entered incorrect card
                  information, such as the card number or expiration date, the
                  transfer may be declined.
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Card restrictions: Some cards may have restrictions on the type
                  of transactions they can be used for, or may be blocked for
                  security reasons. If your card is restricted or blocked, the
                  transfer may be declined.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If your card transfer has failed or was declined, you may need to
                  use a different payment method or contact your card issuer for
                  assistance. If you are unsure why your transfer was declined, you
                  can contact our customer support team for further assistance.

                  If your beneficiary received an amount less than the amount you

                  associated with the transaction. These fees can vary depending on
                  the amount of money you are sending, the countries involved, and
                  the payment method you choose. If you have agreed to pay the fees
                  for the transaction, the amount your beneficiary receives may be
                  reduced by the amount of the fees.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Important Note: we don’t charge any hidden fees – all the fees (to
                  be charged for any money transfer) are clearly shown before money
                  transfer completion.

                <p>
                  • Exchange rates: If you are sending money between two different
                  currencies, the amount your beneficiary receives may be affected
                  by the exchange rate. The exchange rate is the rate at which one
                  currency can be converted into another currency. If the exchange
                  rate has changed since you initiated the transaction, the amount
                  your beneficiary receives may be different than the amount you
                  sent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you are unsure why your beneficiary received a different amount
                  than the one you sent, you can contact our customer support team
                  for further assistance. They may be able to provide more
                  information on the status of the transaction and help you
                  understand the factors that contributed to the difference in the
                  amount received.

                  If your transfer to a bank account with Tonio is still pending,
                  it may be because the transfer is still being processed. Bank
                  transfers can take longer to complete than other payment methods,
                  so it is not uncommon for them to be pending for a period of time
                  before they are completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are several factors that can affect the processing time for
                  bank transfers, including the receiving bank's policies and
                  procedures, the availability of funds in the recipient's account,
                  and any errors or issues that may arise during the transfer

                  If your recipient did not receive money to their card through
                  Tonio, there could be several possible reasons for the issue.
                  Some possible reasons could include:
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Incorrect card information: If you have entered incorrect card
                  information, such as the card number or expiration date, the
                  transfer may not be completed successfully.
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Card restrictions: Some cards may have restrictions on the type
                  of transactions they can be used for, or may be blocked for
                  security reasons. If your recipient's card is restricted or
                  blocked, the transfer may not be completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Insufficient funds: If the recipient does not have enough money
                  in their account or on their card to cover the transaction, the
                  transfer may be declined.
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Card expiration: If the recipient's card has expired, the
                  transfer may not be completed.

                <p>

                  If your recipient is having difficulty using the reference code to
                  claim their funds at a cash payout point through Tonio, there
                  could be several possible reasons for the issue. Some possible
                  reasons could include:
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Incorrect reference code: If the reference code you provided to
                  your recipient is incorrect, they will not be able to use it to
                  claim their funds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Expired reference code: If the reference code has expired (for
                  example, some cash payout points demand to pick up cash in 30
                  days), it will no longer be valid and your recipient will not be
                  able to use it to claim their funds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Claimed reference code: If the reference code has already been
                  used to claim the funds, it will no longer be valid and your
                  recipient will not be able to use it again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  • System issues: If there are any technical issues or errors with
                  our systems, it may prevent your recipient from being able to use
                  the reference code to claim their funds.
