        2.1. The Service enables a Sender to initiate a money transfer ("Sender") through our Website or App
to a specified individual (the "Recipient") as a single transaction (referred to as a "Transfer").

      </div>
      <div class="head">3. What is a Transfer</div>
      <div>
        We provide a money transfer service (“Transfer”) which allows you to send money to other people by
using your TONIO LIMITED Profile. Each time you make a Transfer, these terms are incorporated into
the terms of each Transfer.<br>
We can make a Transfer if you provide us with certain information about you and the recipient. The
information we need from you depends on how you send the funds and how the recipient will receive
the funds.<br>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>How you send, or how
      the recipient, receives
      the funds</th>
      <th>What recipient information you must give us
      </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bank account</td>
    <td>account details as required by the recipient’s account provider. For
      example, if you’re paying someone in the UK, you’ll need their name,
      sort code and account code. If you’re paying someone outside the
      UK, you might need their IBAN or BIC/SWIFT.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Card transfer</td>
    <td>name and the recipient’s 16-digit card number. For this type of
      payment, the payment is sent via a card scheme (such as Mastercard
      or Visa).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cash pick-up</td>
    <td>name plus any other information our local partner may require to
      identify the recipient (such as details about the recipient’s local
      identification documents and address).</td>
  </tr>
</table>
      </div>
      You must provide us with the recipient’s correct details. Not doing so means your payment could be
      delayed or it could go to the wrong person. Depending on the legal requirements of a recipient’s
      location, we may also ask for more information about you or the recipient. To continue making a
      Transfer, you’ll be prompted to fund your Transfer (see Funding your Transfer section below). Once
      you enter these details and fund your Transfer, you’ve authorised a Transfer. We’ll only be able to
      make a Transfer if you’ve funded it using an account or card in your name. If you want to make a
      Transfer in: the same currency as your funding currency, we may charge a fee; or a currency that is
      different to the account or card you used to make a Transfer, we may charge a fee and will
      exchange your money using our exchange rate at the time of the payment. The fees and exchange
      rate for a Transfer will be immediately made available to you. We’ll always tell you of any Transfer
      fees and any applicable exchange rates before you make a Transfer.<br>
      <div>

      </div>
      <div class="head">4. Funding your Transfer</div>
      <div>
        In order to facilitate a Transfer, Tonio Limited offers a variety of funding methods, all accessible through
the Tonio Limited app or website. This includes options such as bank transfers or card payments. It's
crucial to note that Tonio Limited will only accept funds originating from an account or card registered
under your name. Tonio Limited will proceed with your Transfer as soon as we receive the funds or
once our third-party partners confirm the funds' availability. In the event we do not receive the funds
or if the funds do not reach us within a reasonable timeframe, we reserve the right to reverse the
credited amount. If you lack sufficient funds to accommodate this reversal, you are obliged to
reimburse us immediately upon request.<br>
It's important to underline that Tonio Limited does not hold customer funds under any
circumstances. All funds will either be remitted to the beneficiary upon successful transaction
completion or returned to the client if the transaction is rejected<br>

      </div>

      <div class="head">5. Execution of the Transfer</div>
      <div>
        5.1. Before the Sender submits a Transfer, we will provide the following information based on the
Sender's selection: (i) the amount to be sent by the Sender ("Send Amount"); (ii) the amount the
Recipient will receive; (iii) the fees charged to the Sender for the Transfer ("Fees"); (iv) the applicable exchange rate for the Transfer; and (v) the expected execution time (i.e., when the funds will be
available to the Recipient).<br>
5.3. A Transfer will be accepted, and a valid binding contract will be established, when we send an
email to the Sender containing the following information: (i) the reference number required by the
Recipient to receive the Transfer ("Reference Number"); (ii) confirmation of the exact amount to be
made available to the Recipient in the chosen pay-out currency ("Receive Amount"); (iii) confirmation
of the Fees charged; (iv) the exchange rate applied to the Transfer; and (v) the execution time (i.e.,
when the funds will be available to the Recipient) ("Acceptance").<br>
5.4. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse acceptance of a Transfer in the following
circumstances: (a) if accepting the Transfer would result in a violation of any applicable law, regulation,
code, or duty; (b) if accepting the Transfer could subject us to action from any government or regulator;
(c) if the Transfer is associated with fraudulent or illegal activity or is intended for an unlawful purpose;
or (d) if we have made a decision to refuse acceptance in accordance with our internal policies. In
such cases, we will strive, to the extent permitted by law and our internal policies, to provide the reason
for refusing to accept the Transfer.<br>

<div class="head">6. Cash Pick-Up Service with Tonio Limited</div>
<div>
  Tonio Limited offers a secure and convenient service called "Cash Pick-Up," which enables recipients
to receive funds in physical cash from designated pick-up locations. This service provides an
alternative for recipients who prefer receiving cash instead of having funds deposited into their bank
accounts. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the Cash Pick-Up service works:<br>
1. Initiating the Transaction: Log in to your Tonio Limited profile and select the Cash Pick-Up option.
Enter the recipient's details, including their full name as it appears on their identification document and
their location.<br>
2. Choosing a Pick-Up Location: Based on the recipient's location, you will be provided with a list of
available pick-up locations. These locations can include partner banks, financial institutions, or retail
outlets. Select the most convenient pick-up location for the recipient.<br>
3. Transferring Funds: Once you have selected the recipient's information and pick-up location,
proceed with transferring the funds. If necessary, the funds will be converted from your currency to the
recipient's local currency.<br>
4. Confirmation and Collection Code: After a successful transfer, both you and the recipient will receive
a confirmation message containing a unique collection code. The recipient must present this code
along with their identification document when collecting the cash.<br>
5. Cash Collection: The recipient can visit the chosen pick-up location at their convenience and provide
the collection code and their identification to collect the cash.<br>
Please be aware that the cash pick-up times and regulations may vary depending on the specific pickup location. It is crucial to ensure that the recipient has all the necessary details to successfully collect
the funds.<br>

a transfer if it has not been collected, received by the recipient, or credited into the recipient's account.
The sender can request cancellation through our website, mobile app, or customer service helpline.
In the case of cancellation, only the send amount will be refunded.<br>
9.2. If a transfer was unauthorized by the sender or not executed correctly by us, we will refund the
send amount and the fee in accordance with applicable law, provided that (i) the sender notifies us promptly upon becoming aware of the issue, and (ii) the situation is not caused by abnormal and
unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control.<br>
9.3. It is essential for the sender to promptly notify us in case of an unauthorized or incorrectly executed
transfer. We will not process a refund if the sender unduly delays reporting the problem or notifies us
more than 13 months after the transfer acceptance. <br>
</div>
<div class="head">10. Charges and Currency Exchange</div>
<div>
  10.1. The sender is responsible for paying the transfer fee via the selected payment method, which is
the only fee we charge. The sender's card issuer may impose additional fees related to the payment
for the transfer.<br>
10.2. In certain recipient countries, local taxes and service charges may be applied at the time of
collection. For account deposits, the recipient's bank or account provider may charge a fee for
receiving the funds.<br>
10.3. When the sender pays for a transfer in one currency and selects another currency for payout,
the send amount will be converted using our exchange rate. Our exchange rate is based on closing
rates in the global financial markets, with a margin. Exchange rates are subject to market fluctuations
beyond our control and may change multiple times a day<br>
10.4. In some countries, currency conversion occurs only at the time of collection due to local
requirements. In such cases, the exchange rate stated in clause 3.1 is only an estimate, and the actual
exchange rate will be determined at the time of collection, which may affect the receive amount.<br>
10.5. For cash pickup transfers to recipient countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA),
if the receive amount is stated in USD and the collection location does not distribute funds in USD, the
send amount will be converted into the local currency using our or the agent's standard exchange rate.<br>
